What is it?

In essense, this extension allows multiple users across multiple servers to
use one Snappymail installation without the administrator having to create
and configure individual domans.

This extension detects the required hostname from a given email address (for
example, it would use "example.com" as the hostname if a user would
log in as "info@example.com"). 

This hostname is then used for IMAP and SMTP communication.

How to Use:

1) Activate extension
2) Go to settings, and add a new wildcard domain "*"
3) Set your ports/TLS/SSL configuration as needed. These settings will not be
   altered by the extension.
4) Set the SMTP and/or IMAP host fields to "auto", this field will then be
   auto-configured.
5) That's it!
