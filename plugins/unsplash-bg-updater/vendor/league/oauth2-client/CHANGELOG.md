  - Moved provider creation notes to `README.PROVIDER-GUIDE.md`.

## 1.0.0-alpha1

_Released: 2015-06-25_

This release contains numerous BC breaks from the 0.x series. Please note these breaks and refer to the [upgrade guide](GUIDE-UPGRADING.md).

* BREAK: Requires PHP 5.5.0 and greater.
* BREAK: All providers have been moved to separate repositories, one for each provider.
* BREAK: All `public` properties have been set as `protected` or `private` and getters/setters have been introduced for access to these properties.
* BREAK: The `Provider\ProviderInterface` has been removed. Please extend from and override `Provider\AbstractProvider`.
* BREAK: The `Entity\User` has been removed. Providers should implement the `Provider\UserInterface` and provide user functionality instead of expecting it in this base library.
* BREAK: The `Grant\GrantInterface` has been removed. Providers needing to provide a new grant type should extend from and override `Grant\AbstractGrant`.
* A generic `Provider\StandardProvider` has been introduced, which may be used as a client to integrate with most OAuth 2.0 compatible servers.
* A `Grant\GrantFactory` has been introduced as a means to register and retrieve singleton grants from a registry.
* Introduced traits for bearer and MAC authorization (`Tool\BearerAuthorizationTrait` and `Tool\MacAuthorizationTrait`), which providers may use to enable these header authorization types.
