     * a propertyname, such as {DAV:}displayname.
     *
     * Each value is the actual value to be updated. If a value is null, it
     * must be deleted.
     *
     * This method should be atomic. It must either completely succeed, or
     * completely fail. Success and failure can simply be returned as 'true' or
     * 'false'.
     *
     * It is also possible to return detailed failure information. In that case
     * an array such as this should be returned:
     *
     * array(
     *   200 => array(
     *      '{DAV:}prop1' => null,

     *      '{DAV:}prop4' => null,

     * In this previous example prop1 was successfully updated or deleted, and
     * prop2 was succesfully created.
     *
     * prop3 failed to update due to '403 Forbidden' and because of this prop4
     * also could not be updated with '424 Failed dependency'.
     *
     * This last example was actually incorrect. While 200 and 201 could appear
     * in 1 response, if there's any error (403) the other properties should
     * always fail with 423 (failed dependency).
     *
     * But anyway, if you don't want to scratch your head over this, just
     * return true or false.
