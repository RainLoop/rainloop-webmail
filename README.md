### PGP
RainLoop uses the old OpenPGP.js v2
SnappyMail v2.12 uses OpenPGP.js v5, GnuPG and Mailvelope.
SnappyMail is able to use and generate ECDSA and EDDSA keys, where RainLoop does not.

Since SnappyMail tries to achieve the best mobile experience, it forked OpenPGP.js to strip it down.
* remove all unused Node.js
* remove all old browsers support
See https://github.com/the-djmaze/openpgpjs for development

|OpenPGP        	|RainLoop 	|Snappy   	|RL gzip	|SM gzip	|RL brotli	|SM brotli	|
|---------------	|--------:	|--------:	|------:	|-------:	|--------:	|--------:	|
|openpgp.min.js 	|  330.742	|  539.988	|102.388	| 167.371	| 84.241  	|  137.413	|

### Squire vs CKEditor
The [Squire](https://github.com/neilj/Squire) implementation is not 100% compatible yet, but it shows the massive overhead of CKEditor.

Still TODO:

* support for tables (really needed?!?)
* support BIDI (really needed?!?)

|       	| normal	| min    	| gzip  	| min gzip	|
|--------	|-------:	|-------:	|------:	|--------:	|
|squire  	| 122.321	|  41.906	| 31.867	|   14.330	|
|ckeditor	|       ?	| 520.035	|      ?	|  155.916	|

CKEditor including the 7 asset requests (css,language,plugins,icons) is 633.46 KB / 180.47 KB (gzip).

To use the old CKEditor, you must install the plugin.
